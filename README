NAME
    Redis::DistLock - Distributed lock manager using Redis

SYNOPSIS
      use Redis::DistLock;
      my $rd = Redis::DistLock->new( servers => [qw[ localhost:6379 ]] );
      my $mutex = $rd->lock( "foo", 1000 );
      die( "failed to get a lock" )
        if ! $mutex;
      # ... critical section ...
      $rd->release( $mutex );

DESCRIPTION
    This is an implementation of the Redlock algorithm using Redis for
    distributed lock management.

    NOTE: This needs at least Redis version 2.6.12 which brings adds new
    options to the SET command.

METHODS
  new( ... )
    servers
        Array reference with servers to connect to or Redis objects to use.

    retry_count
        Maximum number of times to try to acquire the lock.

    retry_delay
        Maximum delay between retries in seconds.

    version_check
        Flag to check redis server version(s) in the constructor to ensure
        compatibility. Defaults to 1.

  lock( $resource, $ttl [ $value ] )
    Acquire the lock for the given resource with the given time to live (in
    seconds) until the lock expires. Without a given value will generate a
    unique identifier.

  release( $lock )
    Release the previously acquired lock.
